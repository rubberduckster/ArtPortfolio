        Hello my name is Robert and there was once a time where my passion was to run obstacle tracks.
        My mother never believed in me and told me to find other passions. Not having my mothers support really wrecked me.
        You see when I entered a competition to finally show of my talents all I could think of my mothers words "you're a stupid quack, you can't be useful for anything".
        Her words created a mist of doubt and I couldn't focus, I couldn't see!... I ran straight into a pole. 
        For a duck to not be able to duck? what a dissapointment.
